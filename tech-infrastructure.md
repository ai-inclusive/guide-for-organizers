## Meetup account (or any other platform to organize events)
Our main platform to organize events is the meetup.com. We pay for your meetup account annd we set it up as soon as you send us an email. 
If there meetup.com is not a popular platform in your country, just let us know which one you would like to use. In some countries, eventbrite is very popular.
There is also [Get Together](https://gettogether.community/) and [Sympla](https://www.sympla.com.br/)

## E-Mail
You can get a chapter email (yourcity@ai-inclusive.org) which can be set up to forward to all the organizers of a chapter. 
We will ask you about this when you send us an email.

ðŸš¨ [VERY IMPORTANT] Your chapter email account should be used to set up any chapter social media accounts (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc).

## Twitter
Local Twitter handle (optional, but encouraged!) should also use the @AIInclusiveLocation format, for example: @AIInclusiveSF and @AIInclusiveSalvador, with the same name as the meetup.com group name (above). 
If the city name is too long for a Twitter handle, you can use an abbreviation such as @@AIInclusiveSF (instead of @AIInclusiveSanFrancisco). 
The "name" on the account should be "AI Inclusive Location". (e.g. @AIInclusiveSalvador and "AI Inclusive Salvador").

=> Please use your chapter AI Inclusive email address (e.g. yourcity@ai-inclusive.org) to set up Twitter and other social media accounts rather than a personal email address.

=> Don't forget to add the AI Inclusive logo
