# AI Inclusive Starter Kit for New Chapters

## Overview of AI Inclusive

### Our mission is to increase the representation and participation of gender minorities groups in AI (Artificial Intelligence).

### Agreements
- **Leadership**: Leadership roles within AI Inclusive chapters, particularly **organizer** and **co-organizer** roles, are to be held by _women and gender minorities_.

- **Events**: Events should be FREE. 

- **No commercial agenda**: Chapters are started by individuals, not by companies.  Chapters can partner with companies for sponsorship in the form of venue space, food or other supplies.  Chapters and events may not be ‘used’ by a corporation/as a commercial vehicle for private aims.
